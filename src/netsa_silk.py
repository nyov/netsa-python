"""
The netsa_silk module contains a shared API for working with common
Internet data in both netsa-python and PySiLK.  If netsa-python is
installed but PySiLK is not, the less efficient but more portable
pure-Python version of this functionality that is included in
netsa-python is used.  If PySiLK is installed, then the
high-performance C version of this functionality that is included in
PySiLK is used.
"""

# This module exists only to import the needed functionality from
# either PySiLK (via the internal silk._netsa_silk module), or
# netsa-python (via the internal netsa._netsa_silk module) and then
# re-export it.  All information (including the list of symbols to
# export) comes from the module providing the functionality, so that
# this module will never have to change and may remain common to both
# PySiLK and netsa-python installs.  (That is: Since it's always the
# same, it's acceptable for both sources to install the file without
# fear of overwriting each other.
